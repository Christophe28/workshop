# WORKSHOP SEO

Workshop dedicated to SEO during the BeCode bootcamp


## How the workshop will be conducted:

During the workshop, we make the candidates discover what SEO is and understand how it works.

The public is placed in groups of 2 to find out what are the errors of the site they are proposed.

Their challenge will be to redo the site with the good practices of SEO 

They will be presented with the expected version of the site that meets all the SEO criteria

We will end this workshop with a Kahoot!

In this report, you will find the right version of the site.
